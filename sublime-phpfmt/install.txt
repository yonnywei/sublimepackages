# [php.fmt](https://github.com/dericofilho/php.tools) support for Sublime Text 3


Thanks for installing phpfmt for Sublime Text.

Please, before posting an issue that this plugin is not formatting your code, answer the following questions:

- Have you installed PHP in the computer which is running Sublime Text?

- Is PHP configured in the default $PATH/%PATH% variable?

- If PHP is not configured in $PATH/%PATH%, have you added the option "php_bin" in the configuration file with full path of PHP binary?


If you have answered more than one "no", then double check your environment.
